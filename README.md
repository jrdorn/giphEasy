#giphEasy

## Introduction

giphEasy is a simple search engine for GIFs.
Users are greeted with a list of currently trending GIFs,
and may either click on a common search term such as "happy" or "sad," or search for something specific.

I drew inspiration from the official GIPHY site and Tenor, and wanted to practice implementing a similar design using CSS Grid.
